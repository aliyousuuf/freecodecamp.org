        <h1>Learning the Git's Internal</h1>
        <p>The git is a tool that is used to track the changes in text document. The git is used heavily in the 
            software development. There are many other tools before the creating of git. However git stands out in
            some unique ways. Git uses the distributed system architecture which is the main selling point behind
            it. Today the git is the most used software for tracking changes in coding project. At first git seems
            complex but with little effort it can be mastered. The beauty of git's engineering marvel can only be
            appreciated by knowing its internal. This page accumulates some video lectures or tutorial that immensely
            helped me to learn the git's internal. Only then I realized what an wonderful engineering thought went
            beyond the creating of git.

            <h2>Here is another deep dive from the git hosting provider GitLab</h2>
            <p>GitLab is a company that providers git cloud hosting services so they really know git well from
                the git's insider perspective.
